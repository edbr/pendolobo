  title: "THE BIRTH OF JUAN LOBO",
  description: `They said he was born under the big top the night the rain tore through the canvas and the lights went out. His mother — La Loba Humana — was howling not for applause but for mercy, and the men in the freak tent thought it was part of the act. His father, El Equilibrista del Silencio, crossed the rope above her, trying to reach her before the lightning did.

They never found out which came first — the cry of the child or the sound of the rope snapping.

After that, the circus moved on without them. The cages were scrubbed, the posters painted over. Only a rumor remained: a boy raised among rusted wagons and tired beasts, who learned to balance between worlds — half saint, half stray.

He walked the border towns carrying a box of broken music, stamping his mark on anything that would take it: walls, coins, hearts. Some said he was still searching for the sound of his father’s last step, others that he was trying to teach the world how to fall with grace.

They call him Juan Lobo,
the Disordered Wolf,
the son of the rope and the howl.`,

From the creators of *The Hitchcock Lovebirds Popper* and *John Ford’s Hot Short Rodeo Box*, comes the latest addition to the *Cursed Prophet Series* — the Rasputin & Marx Resurrection Popper, an animatronic relic of mysticism, madness, and failed utopias.

    description: `The Jimmy “Cowbell” Carter Peace Accord Popper
Now with 30% more futility and an optional embargo expansion pack!

“The sound of compromise, now available in convenient crank format.”

Step right up to the end of history’s pregame show!
Witness Jimmy Carter, dressed in full clerical regalia, striking a cowbell of divine futility, while Ayatollah Khomeini rises stoically from the sanctified box like a ghost still under embargo.

Turn the crank and watch diplomacy squeal! Each rotation plays a haunting medley of:
• “Sharia in F Major (feat. The Shah’s Bunker Choir)”
• “Habitat for Humanity (and Minor Atrocities)”
• “Casablanca Cabaret (U.S. Version: No Locals Allowed)”
• “Boogie Nights in Tehran” (remastered live from the Swiss embassy basement)

Now with patented SanctionsSync technology: the more you turn the crank, the more global markets collapse in real time!

Carved from reclaimed embassy furniture and lubricated with 1979-grade irony, this collectible is guaranteed to restore your faith in nothing. Each unit is precision-calibrated to leak exactly one sigh of disappointment per revolution.`,
